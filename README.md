# Battlecode 2016

**what_thesis**: _Aaron, Stephen, Ryan, Tamas_


## Results

Our bot finished in 7th/8th place in the 2016 Battlecode tournament, also winning a strategy prize for our Z-day suicide strategy. See team023 for the final version; I really don't remember what all the other ones are. As of November 2016, both Aaron and Tamas graduated, Ryan found a job, and Stephen is sadly still in graduate school.
